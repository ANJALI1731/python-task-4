TASK 4

This project is submitted as Task 4 of my internship, where I developed a machine learning model to classify breast tumors as either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset available in the sklearn.datasets module. I used the Random Forest Classifier algorithm for training the model after splitting the data into training and testing sets. The notebook includes all steps such as data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a prediction example. The final output provides a clear classification result for a given input, demonstrating how machine learning can be applied to assist in basic medical diagnoses.
